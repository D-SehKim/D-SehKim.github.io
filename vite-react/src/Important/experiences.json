      "description": "During my technical internship at Zentropy, I gained hands-on experience in e-bike maintenance, battery management, and product packaging. I developed technical skills in programming microcontrollers using C with the STM32 IDE, creating Python scripts for data management and API integration, and developing a chatbot prototype using AI. My contributions included improving e-bike and battery systems, automating data processes, and laying the groundwork for AI-driven customer interaction tools. This experience enhanced my problem-solving, collaboration, and time management skills, and solidified my interest in a career that blends hardware and software development.",
